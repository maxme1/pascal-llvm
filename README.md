# Compiling Pascal with LLVM

This is a fun toy project in which I am learning LLVM. 

I also wrote [a series of posts](https://maxme1.github.io/blog/2023/09/29/pascal-llvm-1/) where I explain in detail
every concept used in this code. Check it out!

# Usage

```shell
# install the dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# run your source
python main.py source.pas
```
